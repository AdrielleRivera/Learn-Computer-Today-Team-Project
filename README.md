# Project Name - Learn Computer Today Philippines Team One Project.

## Introduction
Welcome to our project! This is a blog website about our experiences as web developers. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we will soon upgrade it to become a social media platform for professionals. We are a group of aspiring web developers, and we want to share our portfolio, experiences, journey, and social media links. In the future, we plan to develop a website or application that can help connect other web developers or any professionals.
